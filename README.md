# pottytrain
All aboard the potty train!

I want to start writting a program that will help my son go to the bathroom:

Some key features will be a reminder that will go off at a specified interval that can be adjusted.
I want to implement a visual sticker interface so that my child can see how they are progressing and after a set number of success would allow for a "larger reward"

I also want to have some small reward or words of encouragement that will happen when succeeds on each attempt.
(Currently I will be defining a success as even getting onto the toilet, as this is the issue we are currently having)


I want the interface to be pretty simple. I want a menu to adjust time reminders and to adjust the large reward.

In my first commits I will just be working on the basic structure and reminder system and then will implement the visual reward. (Eventually I would  like to have "spaces" where the stickers will go with a picture of the "large prize" for when the sticker sheet is filled up)
